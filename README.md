Android WearDrawers Sample
===================================

A simple sample that demonstrates Navigation and Action Drawers, part of Material Design for Wear.

Introduction
------------

Steps for trying out this sample:

            * Compile and install the wearable app onto your Wear device or emulator.
            (**Note:** You must install this app directly to your Wear device or emulator.
            If installed on a phone, it will not be automatically pushed to a paired Wear
            device, see [here][2] for more info).

            This sample uses the planets in our solar system to demonstrate the two Wear
            drawer components and concepts relating to [Wear][1] and [Material Design][3]:
            * Customizes and enables screen/planet changes with the [Navigation Drawer][4]
            * Adds customized actions to each screen using the [Action Drawer][5]
